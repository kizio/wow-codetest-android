WOW Code Test App
---
This is the solution to the Woolworths code test. The original project can be found at:

http://github.com/vicfaith/wow-codetest-android/

As delivered, there were a couple of problems with the test:

* The Gradle configuration files refer to a deprecated version of the build tools. This needs to be updated for current versions of Android Studio to be able to read the project.
* The JSON source doesn't have a specification attached. I would not accept this in a commercial project.

I'm in the process of porting the app to a service instead of using an AsyncTask. It's not currently working, but it's 9:30 pm on Sunday evening, and I'm calling it a night.

This version of the app represents about ten to twelve hours of work. I'd estimate that I'll need a similar amount of time to complete it to the required standard.
